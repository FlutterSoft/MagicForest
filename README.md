# Magic Forest
A little project using html/css to experiment. Had fun playing around with box shadows.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Used HTML and CSS only. Lots of shadow effects. I used flexbox for the grid layout (I hadn't learn grid yet) though obviously grid would be the much better option. 

## Optimizations

Using grid instead of flex for the photo grid layout, would have saved a lot of messing around! Using CSS utility classes instead of the way I did it but hey I'm still learning! 

## Lessons Learned:

Grid works better for... grids! Who would have guessed. CSS quickly becomes muddled if you don't organise it neatly. I need to use utility classes more. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
